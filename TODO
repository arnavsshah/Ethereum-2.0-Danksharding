- Check for rollbacks if assertion fails
- Check if assertions within functions can also be logged
- Check aggregated attestation has been signed by 2/3 majority (get BLS working) 
- Add asynchronousity
- Change slot seconds to 12 and INTERVALS_PER_SLOT processing to INTERVALS_PER_SLOT/4 instead of INTERVALS_PER_SLOT/3
- Periodically remove attestations from the subnets to avoid traversing the entire subnet history
